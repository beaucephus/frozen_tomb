====== 5 catacombs ======
Created Tuesday 17 March 2020

__The stairs descend into and end in standing water, waist deep and freezing cold.__
__Just beyond an archway is a wide hall that extends into the darkness.__
__Lining the walls are niches carved into the bare rock.__
__Each niche holds a moldering old skeleton in rusted armor.__
__On either wall is carved more words in the ancient script__, "EVEN IN DEATH I SERVE THE WAR MOTHER."

This room is 35 feet long and 15 feet wide.

When the characters have nearly reached midpoint in this room, the skeletons will start to twitch and move. 
Until that point they are inert and do not respond to any stimulus. 
The skeletons slide out of their narrow burial holes and attack.

The water causes this room to be difficult terrain, and it also makes it harder to notice the pit trap door in the center of the room, requiring a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.
DC10 dex save or take 2d6 damage from the fall.
The pit is already filled deep with water and water begins falling to the pit from the now open trap door. Use swimming rules.
There is another skeleton armed with a wand of magic missle in the pit.
Trap door closes up again slowly after 3 rounds

**Loot**
Each skeleton has a mithryl circlet on its head. Two mythril beads hang down on either side, like fangs. (10GP per circlet)
