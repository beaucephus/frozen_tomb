This scenario can take place in any mountain pass.

__The locals warned you about this pass, but when you first headed up the mountain the weather was quite cooperative.__
__About a day ago you left the timber line, sticking to the marked trail as it threaded between peaks, always leading you up and up, toward the saddleback between two mighty mountains.__
__Near the center of the pass the weather took an unexpected turn, and soon you were caught in a terrible blizzard.__
__Heavy winds and driving snow created whiteout conditions.__
__Now, with the temperature dropping dangerously, you must find shelter before night falls.__
__Fortunately, you spot a dark hollow in the side of the cliffs, and as you grow closer you see a cave mouth that will be perfect for staying dry in the storm.__

If the characters are reluctant to enter, or wish to exit the dungeon during the adventure, impress upon them the extreme and perilous conditions. 
Characters exposed to the cold must make DC 10 Constitution saves at the end of each hour. 
Characters without cold weather gear, such as thick coats, gloves, and so on, automatically fail this save. 
On a failed saving throw, a character gains a level of exhaustion (see Basic Rules).
Visibility is reduced to 50 feet, and creatures suffer disadvantage on saves to avoid becoming surprised.
