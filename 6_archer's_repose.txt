====== 6 archer's repose ======
Created Tuesday 17 March 2020

__This broad chamber has a tall ceiling decorated with mica.__
__Propped up in niches high on either side are skeletons holding bows.__
__A staircase leads up to a closed stone door, over which are carved the words,__ "MY ARROWS FOR THE WAR MOTHER."
__The floor dips down a little, and now the water is waist-deep, slowing you down quite a bit.__
__The water seems to be coming from under the door at the top of the stairs, forming a cascade down the steps.__

One round after the characters enter, the skeletons animate and attack.
They carry old but decent bows with ten arrows each.

The water is considered rough terrain.
The water makes the stairs very slippery, so moving on them requires a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) to avoid falling prone.

Optional: For an additional challenge, an ochre jelly is floating in the water, and it will move in to attack any living enemies

**Treasure**: Each archer has a gem on its helmet that can be popped off and sold for 20 gp
