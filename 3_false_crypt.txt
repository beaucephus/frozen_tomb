====== 3 false crypt ======
Created Tuesday 17 March 2020

__At the end of the hallway is a heavy stone door which has been shoved open to reveal a large chamber with a vaulted ceiling. __
__Four intricately-carved pillars stand just a few feet inside each corner. __
__On the opposite wall is a stone sarcophagus at the top of a low dais, its lid pried off. __
__On the wall above it is carved more writings. __ "HEREIN LIES YURVAN, SQUIRE OF THE WAR MOTHER. 1344 - 1357."
__In the northeast corner is a huge mound of grasses, fur, spoor and bones. __
__The place reeks.__

An owlbear lives here. It has recently been heavily wounded by something much larger than it.
If it hears the party coming, it will attack from hiding as soon as someone enters the room.

The sarcophagus contains an extremely short human skeleton with a club foot in tattered old clothing.
There is nothing of value.

The pillars are carved into the visage of a woman gazing at the floor in the center of the room.

Any player who suspects something is amiss gains advantage on checks to investigate the room further.

There is a secret door in the floor in the center of the room.

**Loot**
The owlbear was hoarding a Potion of Greater Healing.
