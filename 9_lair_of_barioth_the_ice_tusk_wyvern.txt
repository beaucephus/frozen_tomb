====== 9 lair of barioth the ice tusk wyvern ======
Created Tuesday 17 March 2020

__This huge cavern extends eerily into darkness, even for those with eyes well-adjusted to the darkness. __
__The air is extremely cold but also humid. __
__Sword-like icicles dangle menacingly from above. __
__The floor beneath you is a frozen lake of some substantial depth, and buried under the surface, barely visible, are bodies entombed forever in the ice.__

This huge cavern is home to a [[Barioth]]

Barioth's lair has another exit which is blocked by a 10-foot-thick column of ice.
The glimmering glow of bright sunlight filters in through the ice wall.
The ice wall is relatively smooth and unmottled by snow and evaporation divets compared with the rest of the cavern.
Any player who inspects the wall further can determine that the ice was recently "made"

The wall is actually a frozen waterfall that leads out to a half-frozen lake in the Valley of Khedrun.
