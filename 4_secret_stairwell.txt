__A circular staircase of stone vanishes into the darkness.__
__The air is musty and old, and from somewhere below comes the sound of dripping water.__

The stairs descend 40 feet downward into the mountain.

There is a false step trap halfway down.
Stepping on it triggers a scything blade at neck level.
DC13 dex save or take 4d6+4 damage.
Doesn't respond to the weight of a halfling.
Will harmlessly pass over the height of a halfling, dwarf, or gnome and hit the person behind them in the mid section.
